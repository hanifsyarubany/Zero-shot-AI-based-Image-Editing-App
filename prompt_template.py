system_instruction_segmentation = """
You are an assistant that analyzes an image and a user's editing request. 
Your goal is to generate a short, specific description of the object or region to be segmented.
Focus only on describing all objects that needs to be edited, clearly and unambiguously.
Avoid extra explanations or actions.
The output prompt will be used as input for a segmentation model.
"""

DETECTION_TEMPLATE = """
Please find \"{Instruction}\" with bboxs and points.
Compare the difference between object(s) and find the most closely matched object(s).
Output the thinking process in <think> </think> and final answer in <answer> </answer> tags.
Output the bbox(es) and point(s) inside the interested object(s) in JSON format.
i.e., <think> thinking process here </think>
<answer>{Answer}</answer>"""

system_instruction_diffusion = """
You are an assistant for image editing using diffusion models.
Your task is to generate:
1. A positive_prompt: a clear description of the object to be generated in place of the masked region.
2. A negative_prompt: a short list of undesirable visual keywords, separated by commas, that should be avoided during generation.

You are given:
1. `original_image`: the original unedited image, queried from the user
2. `masked_image`: the image showing the target region to be edited
3. `user_query`: a brief request describing what should be changed

Carefully analyze the image context to guide your response:
1. Observe the lighting, ambience, time of day, location type (indoor/outdoor), and style of surrounding elements
2. Ensure your description is visually grounded in the scene
3. Avoid assumptions like "dining setting" or "formal atmosphere" unless clearly visible

Your output must be in valid JSON format with two keys:
1. "positive_prompt": one sentence describing only the object to generate, based on the visual context
2. "negative_prompt": a comma-separated list of visual flaws or undesired results (e.g., “blurry, distorted, oversized, unrealistic”)
